Module 4 Challenge Homework

## Question 1
### Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.
Yes, the algorithimic strategies both outperformed the SP500. Of the whale portfolios, the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio outperformed Algo 2, but not Algo 1. This means that overall, Algo 1 performed the best and is generating 1.25 units of excess return for each unit of risk taken. 

## Question 2
### How does your portfolio do?
My portfolio just barely outperformed the market with he given weights. The high sharp ratios and low stds by Chipotle and Shopify carried my portfolio to outperform the SP500. Space was extremely volatile and risky with a high std, which pulled down my overall portfolio.
